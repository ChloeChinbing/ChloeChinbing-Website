        <p class="lead mb-4">Nice to meet you, my name is Chloe. I can communicate in English fluently and in French and Mandarin proficiently. I have strong intrapersonal and conflict resolution skills due to always being around people of all ages. Additionally, I am a very neat person with excellent time management skills. I am proficient in Microsoft Office, Excel, and Access. Along with having graphic design experience (Photoshop, Illustrator, ProCreate). I have lots of experience working with kids and young adults as I have been a math tutor, a camp counselor, and a swim instructor. While tutoring, my responsibilities were to ensure that all my students exceeded in whichever math level they were in. I made practice tests, worksheets, and tutorials weekly for every student to make sure they comprehended everything they learned 100%. I tutored in person and through online measures such as Skype, Zoom, and Google Meets. As a camp counselor, I worked with kids from the ages of four to twelve. I assisted the camp staff with teaching the children songs, choreography, and crafts for two camps: Mini Music Camp and Beginner Violin Camp. I ensured their safety and well being, while creating a lively and enjoyable environment for the children at camp. <br><br>

        In high school, I was a part of the Make-A-Wish Foundation, leadership committee, WAVE (Water Awareness Volunteer Efforts) Committee and Music Council. Being involved in the schools I was at helping me become more confident in public speaking and standing up for what I believe in. In high school, I was also a part of a string quartet playing at the Moir Center Trillium Health Hospital. At Trillium Health Hospital, I played violin pieces as well as with a quartet for patients with Alzheimer's, Dementia, or other terminal illnesses. We were able to utilize music, bringing an ounce of joy to people whose lives are filled with darkness. The whole experience was very special and while I also gained public speaking and performance skills. <br><br>

        During COVID-19, I participated in a few organizations with causes I cherish. I joined the Honoring Healthcare Heroes Virtual Volunteer program where I Wrote letters and made posters to thank, encourage and cheer on nurses, doctors, hospital staff, ill patients, families affected by COVID-19. I sent a total of 25 letters to over 15 different hospitals to healthcare workers. I was also a part of The Brain Exercise Initiative Virtual Volunteer. They are an organization focused on preventing memory loss through brain exercise for Alzehimer patients of all ages. They mainly focus on older adults, but I met several mid-aged adults as well. The experience was very rewarding as I got to help those who have Alzheimer's. Using Skype or Zoom, I worked on basic math, writing, and reading aloud exercises with individuals.
